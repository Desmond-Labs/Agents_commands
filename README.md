# ORBIT Agents & Commands Collection

A curated collection of specialized AI agents and slash commands designed to enhance Claude Code with advanced debugging capabilities and workflow automation for the ORBIT image processing platform.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains sophisticated agent definitions and slash commands that extend Claude Code's capabilities with specialized debugging workflows and ORBIT-specific automation. Each agent is designed with specific expertise areas and integrates seamlessly with Claude Code's task execution framework.

## ü§ñ Specialized Debugging Agents

The repository includes a comprehensive 4-phase debugging system with integrated logging and token tracking:

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering
**`debugger-evidence-gatherer`**
- **Purpose**: Forensic debugging specialist for comprehensive system investigation
- **Features**: 
  - Must be used FIRST before any debugging attempts
  - Never makes code changes - only investigates and documents
  - Integrates GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipeline analysis
  - Includes comprehensive error analysis and system state investigation
  - Built-in logging integration with session tracking

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis  
**`debugger-root-cause-analyst`**
- **Purpose**: Scientific root cause analysis using systematic hypothesis testing
- **Features**:
  - Uses scientific method to identify actual root causes vs symptoms
  - Systematic hypothesis testing with evidence validation
  - Never makes code changes - only analyzes and concludes
  - Cross-hypothesis validation and evidence chain construction
  - Confidence scoring and quality metrics

### Phase 3: Surgical Implementation
**`debugger-solution-surgeon`**
- **Purpose**: Precision fix implementation with minimal system impact
- **Features**:
  - Makes minimal, targeted fixes based on confirmed root cause analysis
  - Never fixes unrelated issues or makes "while I'm here" improvements
  - Includes pre-surgery safety protocols and rollback procedures
  - Surgical precision with change tracking and validation
  - Implementation quality metrics and risk assessment

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Validation
**`debugger-validator`**
- **Purpose**: Final gatekeeper ensuring complete solution validation
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive testing of root cause resolution
  - Regression testing and edge case validation
  - Performance and security impact assessment
  - Integration and compatibility testing
  - Final quality assurance with detailed analytics

## üöÄ ORBIT Workflow Agents

### Frontend Architecture

  - Cosmic design system compliance (Deep Navy, Orbit Blue, Orbit Teal)
  - Organic intuitionist UX methodology
  - Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture principles
  - ORBIT brand identity integration
  - Component design with 8px border radius and elevated dark surfaces

### Workflow Processing
**`orbit-workflow-processor`**
- **Purpose**: Complete ORBIT image processing workflow automation
- **Features**:
  - End-to-end order processing from pending to complete
  - AI image analysis with Google Gemini integration
  - Metadata embedding and XMP packet creation
  - Storage verification and database reconciliation
  - Email notifications and cleanup procedures

## üõ† Key Features

### Integrated Logging System
All debugging agents include comprehensive logging integration:
```bash
# Initialize logging session
/debug-log [agent-name] start "Session description"

# Log key findings
/debug-log [agent-name] log "Detailed findings with evidence"

# Complete session with metrics
/debug-log [agent-name] complete "Session summary with confidence scores"
```

### Token Tracking & Analytics
- Comprehensive token usage estimation
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Performance metrics and efficiency tracking
- Session analytics and continuous improvement insights

### Anti-Loop Prevention
- Systematic 4-phase process prevents debugging loops
- Evidence-based decision making
- Hypothesis testing rigor
- Validation completeness requirements

## üìã Usage Guidelines

### For Debugging Workflows
1. **Always start with `debugger-evidence-gatherer`** - Never skip evidence collection
2. **Follow the 4-phase sequence** - Each phase builds on the previous
3. **Use logging integration** - Track progress and maintain audit trails
4. **Complete each phase fully** - Don't skip to solutions without proper analysis

### For ORBIT Development
1. **Use `orbit-frontend-architect`** for all UI/UX work
2. **Use `orbit-workflow-processor`** for order processing automation
3. **Maintain cosmic brand compliance** - Follow the established design system
4. **Integrate with existing ecosystem** - Ensure seamless user experience
