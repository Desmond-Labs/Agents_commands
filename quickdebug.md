# /quickdebug - Fast Debugging for Common Issues

Rapidly debug common issues using streamlined evidence gathering and targeted root cause analysis. Perfect for everyday debugging scenarios.

## Usage

```bash
# Quick error debugging
/quickdebug "Function returning undefined instead of user object"

# Quick performance issue
/quickdebug "Page loading slowly after recent deployment"

# Quick build/test failure
/quickdebug "Tests failing after dependency update"

# Quick configuration issue  
/quickdebug "Environment variables not loading in production"
```

## üöÄ Streamlined Process

**Optimized for Speed:** Focuses on most likely causes first, with fallback to comprehensive analysis if needed.

## üéØ Fast-Track Decision Logic

**Common Issue Patterns:**
- **Undefined/Null Errors:** ‚Üí Check data flow and API responses
- **Build Failures:** ‚Üí Check dependencies and environment  
- **Performance Issues:** ‚Üí Check recent changes and resource usage
- **Configuration Problems:** ‚Üí Check environment variables and settings

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Initial hypothesis fails validation
- Multiple related issues discovered
- Security or data integrity concerns
- Complex system interactions involved

## ‚ö° Quick Mode Benefits

- **Speed:** 5-10 minute resolution for common issues
- **Efficiency:** Focused investigation prevents over-analysis
- **Pattern Recognition:** Leverages common debugging scenarios
- **Escalation Path:** Seamlessly escalates to full debugging if needed

## üîÑ Auto-Escalation
